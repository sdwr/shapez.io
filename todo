add translations for resources
translation file is created in code...
where does data come from?
base-en.yaml


NOT DONE:
	performance
		under 100 fps without GPU
		:(

	FIX TARGETING - some units take a second to target/retarget
		need attack cooldown
		hp bars DONE
		to diagnose

	controls
		keyboard controls for building (e for mine, r for combat?)
		mouse wheel changes selected?

	economy
		buildings cost gold
		units cost gold? leaning no
		exploring tiles costs gold/time?
		upgrades?
			mine upgrade = more workers EASY
			unit upgrade should be between levels

	animations
		projectiles
		attack (at least show cooldown on units/buildings)
		building

	minimap
		can reuse tutorial pane (keep for tutorial)

	more unit types
		need to generalize barracks and fighter
			BarracksSystem
			MetaBarracks
			MetaFighter
		ideas
			footman
			zergling

			necromancer
			blizzard


polish:
	sprites not centered (change origin to center? dont break map or drawSprite)
	rallying units jitter
		have them spread out after reaching destination, not before
	give other team different colors
		worst case remake sprites manually
		ideally find css tint
	player is drawn over/under units? make consistent



DONE:

resource map: DONE
	**NOTE: resource list hardcoded multiple places**
	**NOTE not saving?**

chunk create/delete: DONE
	buttons are hardcoded
	not saving
		chunks need to be added as serializable objects
		but just the flag
		how do entities get readded to chunk after load?
			serializerInternal places all entities and creates chunks

resources need to be serialized DONE
option 1:
	turn resources into entities
	resource is a type of metaBuilding
	need to be able to place buidlings over resources?
		buildings go in regular layer
		resources go in lower layer
	to use sprite code etc, need to make 1 metabuilding per resource
	use staticbuildingcomponent + add resource component to track amt


	add code to placebuilding THIS ONE
	add code to deserialize to lower layer
	get everythign else for free


collect resources from mine DONE
	add amt to resource - 98/100 etc
	display amt?
		there has to be a selection pane at some point
		lower part of the screen
		maybe reuse the tutorial window that already exists in lower left

	make mine building


add workers DONE
	easiest movement is straight-line moving back and forth
	harder is pathfinding

	needs

	needs DynamicMapEntityComponent
		fields: speed, destination, origin
		triggers logic when hits destination (message sent to workersystem?)

		how will path work???
			ignore terrain is easy
			dont want to recompute path all the time
				will have to cache, recompute when chunk dirty flag hit
				have to know what chunks are on path

	needs MovementSystem DynamicMapEntitySystem

	add worker sprite


		add deserialize
			make sure deserializie adds to chunk
		add createDynamicEntity
		add metaunit base + extensions
		complete dynamicEntitySystem drawChunk() by calling metaunit base per entity

		rename MetaBuilding + registry to MetaEntity
		do something with defaultVariant

		how to create
		meta_unit system like buildings?
		need one place to add components from
		and load sprites/animations
		done - updated map.placeEntity()



	needs WorkerSystem (GameSystemWithFilter)
		updates destination/origin

	how to handle gathering?
	option 1: WANT THIS
		each mine has 4 worker slots
		one per side
		resources are gathered at speed 4 workers can get to builindg/back

		tradeoff:
		easier logic
		doesnt need dedicated controls
		caps workers w/o needing total cap

	option 2:
		assign workers to buildings
		cap at 5/10/w/e
		resources gathered at mine speed
		like sc2 mineral patches, only 1 worker inside at a time

		tradeoff:
		logic still easy
		needs +/- control and total count

	option 3: DID THIS
		workers auto-gather

		tradeoff:
		more complicated worker logic
		find available work
		more handsoff









what kind of game?

want tight earlygame like starcraft
	efficiency
	a few decisions in a few minutes
		barracks or worker?
		timing/order should (kind of) matter

mixins:
	reroll map tiles
	upgrades/tech tier between levels
	mythic+ enemy modifiers
	level grade (goal time, bonus objectives)

strategy/idle/puzzle
------------------
want resource constraints
hands off strategy?
	uncontrollable units
	build tech, place auras
	workers cost food (= energy/electricity)


map moves instead of player
tiles can be bought/replaced
	adds random/puzzle mechanics
	adds resource sink (reroll for good tiles)
	adds agency/puzzle feel
	adds loss (deleting tile with buildings/upgrades)

tile ecosystem?
	rivers/mountains run over multiple tiles
	replacing non-source tile
		same result
		or changes to other possible position (uncertainty bubble)
	adjacent tiles affect each other
	reroll tiles to create ideal landscape

requires:
	idle mechanics
	tuned rewards
	interactions between buildings/tiles


tooth and tail
--------------
control player unit (doesn't attack)
build with keyboard + positioning
move with rally

player actions:
	build/upgrade economy
	scout
	pick battles + micro

requires:
	units
	combat
	pathfinding
	enemies
	loot/points of interest
	bosses
	upgrades






wc3:
game speed - workers collect resources in 5/10s
	- constant movement means 1/2s

player motivators
	accumulate
		collect resources
		build base
		grow army
		get/level heros

	explore
		building types
		units
		upgrades
		enemy camps
		items
		map

	compete
		fight opponent
		optimize build
		army size/hero level/base tier

game loop:
	collect resources
	spend resources
		building
		unit
		upgrade
		expand

game view is letterbox
top corner is resources
bottom row is map/progress/choose unit/building/upgrade

three concurrent games
	collect/spend - top and bottom corner
		navigate tech tree using resources

	"real" game - map and positioning

	metagame - judge army vs enemy


hooks in order
	instant:
	can move around workers
	workers collect money

	medium:
	explore buildings/units
	grow army

	game:
	level up
	kill enemy

	meta:
	see story
	refine build order

---
loop hero:
game speed:
	movement every second
	fight every 5/10 seconds
		attack every second
		animations
		no real input during battle
	pick card every 30s
	examine item every 30s
	change item every 1/2m

player motivators
	accumulate
		cards
		build level
		level up
		items
		metagame resources

	explore
		cards
		enemies
		bosses
		items
		card interactions
		classes
		buildings
		conversations

	compete
		defeat boss

game loop
	fight enemies
	play cards
	pick items

meta loop
	manage base
		build buildings
		pick trinkets
	unlock cards
	unlock classes
	create loadout

map is square(ish)
	top side is day timer/boss timer/speed/pause
	right side is items/inv/detail panel
	bottom is hand of cards

	battle pops up over map
