add gathering from resource patches
	by magic or by worker?

resource map:
	**NOTE: map not safe**
	**NOTE not saving?**





what kind of game?
strategy/idle/puzzle

want resource constraints
hands off strategy? 
	uncontrollable units
	build tech, place auras
	workers cost food (= energy/electricity)
	

map moves instead of player
tiles can be bought/replaced
	adds random/puzzle mechanics
	adds resource sink (reroll for good tiles)
	adds agency/puzzle feel
	adds loss (deleting tile with buildings/upgrades)
	
tile ecosystem?
	rivers/mountains run over multiple tiles
	replacing non-source tile 
		same result
		or changes to other possible position (uncertainty bubble)
	adjacent tiles affect each other
	reroll tiles to create ideal landscape
	


wc3:
game speed - workers collect resources in 5/10s
	- constant movement means 1/2s

player motivators
	accumulate
		collect resources
		build base
		grow army
		get/level heros
		
	explore
		building types
		units
		upgrades
		enemy camps
		items
		map
	
	compete
		fight opponent
		optimize build
		army size/hero level/base tier

game loop:
	collect resources
	spend resources
		building
		unit
		upgrade
		expand
		
game view is letterbox
top corner is resources
bottom row is map/progress/choose unit/building/upgrade

three concurrent games
	collect/spend - top and bottom corner
		navigate tech tree using resources
	
	"real" game - map and positioning
	
	metagame - judge army vs enemy
	
	
hooks in order
	instant:
	can move around workers
	workers collect money
	
	medium:
	explore buildings/units
	grow army
	
	game:
	level up
	kill enemy

	meta:
	see story
	refine build order

loop hero:
game speed:
	movement every second
	fight every 5/10 seconds
		attack every second
		animations
		no real input during battle
	pick card every 30s
	examine item every 30s
	change item every 1/2m
	
player motivators
	accumulate
		cards
		build level
		level up
		items
		metagame resources
	
	explore
		cards
		enemies
		bosses
		items
		card interactions
		classes
		buildings
		conversations
		
	compete
		defeat boss
		
game loop
	fight enemies
	play cards
	pick items

meta loop
	manage base
		build buildings
		pick trinkets
	unlock cards
	unlock classes
	create loadout
	
map is square(ish)
	top side is day timer/boss timer/speed/pause
	right side is items/inv/detail panel
	bottom is hand of cards
	
	battle pops up over map
